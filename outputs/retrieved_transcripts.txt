why is there God
would God ask this God is alright as he
is right so are you asking is there God
or rise there God why is there God I'm
asking would God ask this question
because God even by your concepts is
complete
hence contended he won't ask why do I
exist so if God won't ask this and you
then you're asking why is God there
surely you have some idea of God right
for example you may ask why is this pole
here so you have an image an idea of the
pole what is your definition of God the
complete one what is your idea of God so
oneness means no deficiency no parts so
go by just your definition even by your
image even by your own concept of God is
God likely to ask this question it is
often more important to see why this
question is arising why when where what
all of these are words relevant only to
the mind not to God why means cause and
effect why means time why means the past
a reason whatever you do has a reason
and there is something that has no
reason at all that is God so by
definition the world why does not apply
to God but you will come to have faith
in it only when you find out something
in life that is unreasonable have you
ever loved unreasonably without thinking
of profit without thinking of future or
hope then you will love unreasonably
then you will know that an unreasonable
God can exist and does exist then you
will also know that only that
unreasonable one has any value at all
but first of all you have to admit that
unreasonableness in your life duty and
do you do anything without bothering for
profits
surely you're doing something huh you do
that act is God now why does that exist
why do you do certain things without
if it makes you feel good then you have
a profit so I'm asking is there anything
that you do absolutely without profit
figure that out you surely must be
familiar with some such thing that is
God and that alone is beautiful and
valuable
God most clearly shows up in all that
which is crazy about you
God does not show up in your business
transactions oh he's there as well but
he doesn't show up
God doesn't show up in the way you
operate in your social life
what shows up in the way you suddenly
fall in love God shows up in the way you
leave everything behind to come to a
stranger God shows up in the way you are
prepared to give up even your body for
that's where God expresses himself to
you to you
otherwise he's expressing himself all
do something without purpose act without
motives give without bothering for
returns love without bothering for
tomorrow learn without bothering for
the uncaused one the first one the one
and if you cannot enter any of that then
observe all your actions then with a
reason for a profit for a benefit even
he is not called omnipresent for nothing
even in all your calculations and many
but there you have to observe a little
what is present not only in selfless
love but even in self centric attachment
if your life is full of attachments then
observe just your attachments there -
but an instantaneous immediate royal way
is to find God not in attachments but in
love

that the first mistakes
happen because we are not confident of
ourselves.
We do not feel assured enough to say
that the scripture might be
wonderful. It might be containing pulse
of wisdom but it is arising from a human
mind. It has not descended from
anywhere. It is arising from a human
mind. Simply accept it. And that
requires a certain assuredness. We don't

because we are parallelly quite
arrogant. So we say whatever is the
truth I can think of it. I will not
submit to it. I will think of it. Hence
we coin this threeletter
silent? Why keep
thinking? Because we are quite arrogant.
Because we say that I will capture the
ultimate reality in my mind. Now this is
paradoxical. On one hand, when a sacred
book comes in front of you, you don't
have the guts to admit that a man wrote
this book. It did not descend from the
heavens. You don't have the guts to
admit that. Look at the
paradox. On one hand, you don't have the
guts to admit that this book is coming
from a human mind.
On the other hand, we are so arrogant
that we want to say that we know what

complex that when we come across

would want to
admit that Mary was the corporal mother

Jesus because accepting this will be a
great responsibility upon all

Jesus, then what are all the other
And to accept that Jesus was just a
normal human being like the rest of us

man invented the concept of
God only so that he can be away from
need by
putting the ultimate in these three
letters G O D. What did you
do? You gave yourself the assurance that
I know what the ultimate is. After all,
I have been able to capture him in three
letters. G O
D. Now, even if I say that God cannot be
spoken of, God cannot be thought of.
Whatever I say would be a
statement saying something about God
thereby implying that I know at least
this
much. Even if you say that nothing can
be known about God. You have known at
least this much. Right? What? That
nothing can be known about God. Now ego

Give him a
name and then say, "Oh, he cannot be

surely there is some hope that you can
know more. Huh? Just a little bit more.
Oh, you are shy in admitting it, right?
But one corner of your
mind is wishing, hoping and is certain
that you know if I can say three letters
about him then I can also probably one
day write three books about him and then

decide when to surrender and what to

matter then surely you are
bigger than surrender

He written volumes and volumes praising
God.
Now if you give yourself the right to
praise God then surely you have also
given yourself the right to someday not
praise
him. There would be very few people who
would say who am I to praise you even to
praise you
who I must know
you. But you know what do we do? We say,
"Oh God, you are the greatest because
you made this world." So now I know that
he made this
world. I know this much that he made
this world. You really know that he made
this
world. The world is like your
teacup. Something to be
will dream up stories and stories and
myths and myths about how the world was
created. And then this was said by God
to that. And then on third day God made
this and sixth day he made this, seventh

of your arrogance and your

Firstly, let's admit that every holy
book comes from the mind and the mind is
well within its right to talk about

Let the mind look at itself and that is
the most sacred

God then the mind is crossing its
limits.
There is a reason

reflections, I say look at yourself and
write how are you doing? What are you
thinking? Where is your mind going?
Because that is the
Looking at the world, thinking of the

We find it very very
assured that the ego that we have
You know I
surrendered my ego to my favorite
deity. I'm sure he will take care of my
ego. He will not hurt it or destroy it.
So we like to feel good. I surrendered
to XY Z
God. Now it is the responsibility of
that God to take care of my ego.
Right? Have you really surrendered then?
Have you really then known the reality
of
ego? Don't you see how you find it
easier to surrender after you have known
a particular person and especially if
you
are on sweet terms with that
person because now when you are
surrendering you are sure that he will
not hurt the thing that you have
surrendered. What is the thing that you
surrender? There you go. And if the
person is friends with me and he talks
nicely with me and he's so sweet, then I
find it easy to surrender. Now I can
give my precious thing to him. If the
ego is still precious to you, what have
you
surrendered? So you like
always to have somebody to whom you can
surrender and that
somebody must be acceptable to whom? To
the ego. Now what is being surrendered?
The ego. And who is deciding to whom to
surrender? The
ego. Can there be anything more stupid
than
this? Just
surrender. Do not decide to whom to
surrender. This befuddles the
mind. It starts feeling choked. It says,
"But but but surrender means I'm giving
it to somebody, right?" No, you're not
giving it to anybody. You're just giving
it
up. Do you realize the difference?
Giving it to somebody would mean when
the time comes I can take it back. And
giving it up means it's gone. I do not
know where it's gone. It's gone. Just
This finished. No trace left. Just

imagine put in your pocket point at him
anything whenever the person will try to
talk of God he will always attribute a
name a figure of form to the truth that
being what he is what else would he do
he will say God is beautiful now what
does beautiful mean beautiful as the
rose so he has brought down God to the
level of the rose now the rose will be
there away God would also be there away
now the rose is very beautiful to
somebody and not as beautiful to the
other one so the perception of God too
must be subjective then do not talk of
God as a person as a person talk only of
the person and see what it means to live
as a person what does it mean to live
the person meaning what does it mean to
what's your name here what does it mean
to live as hiral you know what here L is
here L is the name given to him by
somebody and hence the expectations
obligations attached with it and hence
the whole burden of knowledge and hence
a pre-decided future that is what the
person is the person must limit himself
to the person because that is his proper
domain if you will try to go beyond
we will only get more of the person but
name it as God and that is blasphemy
that is not quite right huh God is
neither personal nor impersonal God is
not there is nothing called god what is
not a thing what is nothing that you can
think of so don't even talk about God
that is the best and the highest respect
you can pay to God do not even talk of
him by talking of him you malign him by
building a church for him you bring him
down to your own dimension by praising
him you lay same with attributes that
are suitable only two humans but that is
the kind of treatment we have been
giving truth and that explains the kind
of treatment we have been given to
ourselves that explains why we suffer
because we talk so much about God leave
God alone don't touch that purity with
your dirty hands well said well said
whenever we will talk we will run into
these contradictions so do not even say
that God is very pure just say that I
feel that I am not quite pure and will
stop no need to talk about God because
whenever you will say God is pure you
will have some image of purity again you
are doing the unthinkable again you are
doing what you must not do God is not
even pure God is not even superior god
is not great at all because if God is
greater than Alexander also great and
you have brought down got to the level
of Alexander if God is greatest it is
still a comparative statement greatest
to whom compare it to whom so you are
still comparing God to something and you
are comparing something to something
else they both must be in the same
dimension so you cannot even say God is
greatest just hold yourself from
thinking of God think rather of your own
situation and think deep
we deeply that is real religiosity do
not remember God do not remember God
because you cannot remember God you will
remember something else thinking that it

himself. God has no business calling

no
entity outside of
that that would call out to
him. And therefore God is never going to
refer to himself or herself in any way
in any language let alone in any
specific gender. So the first
absurdity is when God is referred
to referred to not as him or her. The
first absurdity is
when God is referred to at all in the
first place.
God? If
God is all and
everywhere, from where did
this
speaker
emerge to call out to God or to exclaim
God. So first thing you have to see is
that when you are referring to God, it
is not God you are referring to. It is
your God that you are referring to. God
cannot be referred
to. God is so total that making any
reference to him is
impossible. God is so total that the
reference itself would be inside God not
outside. Now how do you refer to a body
something
anybody from inside of
him? It is impossible.
You have to be away outside
somewhere. You have to be separate to
talk of
somebody. So whenever somebody talks of
what, it is the first
absurdity. Now that absurdity explains
the next
absurdity. What is the next absurdity?
that not only do we refer to God, we
refer to
God in a particular gender. Not only do
we refer to God in a particular gender,
ways.
Hindus, millions of ways they have to

these 100 names? These 100 names come

forms,
self depending on who you are and
whatever you are is false.
Please that has to be understood because
there's nothing outside of God and when
you are referring to God surely you are
not referring to yourself or are you?
First of all we have said that when you
refer to God it is an absurdity. Now we
are using this absurdity to explain a
related absurdity. And what is the
related absurdity? That we refer to
God in
very anthropomorphic terms. We refer to
God as if
he's a human being with a certain
nationality. H sometimes, just
occasionally, we refer to God as an
animal as
well. And when we want
to exhaust
our limits, then we start referring to
God as that or the sky or silence.
or something but we still want to use
some words and every word as you know
refers only to an object a material
object. So for example when you talk of
God as
joy
bhagan. So when you refer to him as the
joyful
joy, the one who blesses his subjects
with joy, then surely you are not
talking so much of God. You are making a
revelation about your own
condition. What is your own condition?
You are bored and frustrated and
irritated and tense.
And this condition of the self is
looking for its
dissolution. Its dissolution it cannot
talk of because its dissolution is the
state of unknown. This state knows only
existence not
non-existence. So it cannot talk of what
is
there beyond frustration or stress or
tension.
So it creates some kind of an opposite a
dualistic
opposite. So if you are frustrated then
you will start calling God
When you are frustrated with your
limited presence, limited spatial
presence on this
planet and you hate it that you
cannot keep an eye
over what your son is
doing with his
lunchbox was the school is 5 kilometers
away. Then you start calling God as
omnipresent.
You are calling him omnipresent because
you do not like the fact that your

for some

great
angst and fury over
your
importance. The bugger came and beat me
up.
I'm so important. When you are
important, then God is
omnipotent because you cannot do
anything. So you dream up a God who can
do everything.
Everything. Are you getting
it? So
when a woman and a woman is going to
have a woman's mind, right? The mind of
the woman
throughout. So when a woman wants to end
her
misery she
conceives a redeeming
figure obviously in the masculine it is
not absolutely
necessary but 99 out of 100 times this
You may come across instances where a
woman is worshiping a female deity. That
is possible. But
instinctively, biologically,
dualistically, what is going to happen
is that if you are a
woman, then the one you would look
forward to to take you out of your
miseries would be a man. Especially if
you are an adult woman. Especially if
sex. Now one of the
great miseries of adult human life is
that sex is never fully
satisfying. It promises so much but
delivers
So you now know why God has to be an
omnipotent
male. Fred will tell you that is because
omnipotent. Are you getting it? It is
not necessary. But you get the drift,
don't
in a sexual angle between the relation
of the worshipper and the
woripped. It is not merely a sexual
angle. It is a human
angle. If you are famished, if you are
impoverished, then to you God would be a
provider of abundance. Who is God?
Who provides? God is a provider.
Everything that this little self, this
mind craves
for, it will project in
a
God. Obviously that God is not real. But
then mankind probably has no option.
That's what human beings will continue
to do.
H in deep deep
meditiveness you stop according genders
ultimate. That is why the pinnacle is
merely
silence. In silence there are
no
words that point at godliness and
it? In fact, Rusemarin, this should tell
you about the helplessness of the human
condition.
Forget about
really reaching God and merging with
him. We are so very helpless that even
him, we actually start talking of a
self-projected absurd
image. So incapable is this little self
of
even talking of God let alone reach
God. It talks of God and it starts
stupid. If it cannot even talk of God,
how will it travel to

happening who is the master in all these
So on one hand I'm talking about
god
h god the one beyond me. God the one
very much
beyond me. On the other hand, I am
worshiping that small little
god that I think myself to
be. What does that make
me? A polytheist. I profess one god, I
worship another. Even when I'm talking
of Brah whom am I actually woriing?
And myself does not
mean me the equivalent of Brahma. Here
myself is not the Aam that is same as
ego. All of us are guilty of polytheism
in that sense.
We all
worship at least two gods of which in
Now do you see what Abui Hazid is
saying that you might be paying lip
service to the unity of godhood. You
might be saying anything about
surrender, about
oneness. But
actually your first master is your ego.
And in front of that
ego, you do not give consideration even
to
God because you use God to place your
ego. And what does that show in terms of
the relative importance that you give to
ego and God? Who gets the higher
consideration? My ego. The proof of that
Ego is not not the proof of that is that
you will not allow God to use your
ego but you will let ego use God as per
your little
designs. Now there can be no doubt about
who is superior in our eyes. Who is
H in fact we need not even call
ourselves polytheists. We
all worship only one
God. Even polytheism is too much
us. The power of our while is
underestimated when we are called
polytheists. We aren't polytheists. We
know only one god and that god is the
ego. The teacher
deliberately gives a task to the asetic
that will shred down his ego.
There is
nothing particularly
spiritual about the task he assigns this
aesthetic. What is the task he assigns?
Shave your beard head. What else? Going
to market. Go into
marketing rags. Huh? Get everybody.
Proclaim yourself to be a fool. Ask
people to slap you. Give and give nuts
to kids. Now obviously these have no
absolute spiritual significance
yet they are of great significance in
context of this particular disciple and
that is the role of the
teacher.
The Shiva sutras
assert that guru
is
up. That
guru is the one who understands and is
Upai means
method
away with this asetic who has been
sitting with the master since long and
yet has not been able to unbburden
himself. This is probably the only way
to expose his ego. He comes to the
master and says, "You know what? I want
a piece of your divine knowledge. I have
been sitting with you since so long and
yet why am I not shining with the same
light as you
do? The teacher says because you have
covered yourself with
darkness because you have wheeled
shine? The light is there but the light
is covered covered covered with the
darkness of your ego. So even if you
have spent 30 years with me, as is the
case here, even if you have spent 30
years with me, yet you would remain
encased, you'd still know no
light because you're not prepared to
shed
yourself. The disciple would not agree.
He says, "No, master. I've been with you
since so long. Obviously, my ego has
supplimated.
I'm not that egoistic. You see, why
don't you test me? The master says, all
right. And if the master is really a
master, he knows the pulse of the
disciple. He says, you go
ahead. You take off your respectability.
Now, this cannot be
done. That is one of the things that you
must always take off before you come to
the guru. Your sense of social
respectability.
What will people
say? You see, had this acetic been told
to do all of these things in private,
not in the
market, he might have probably
agreed. What bothers him is what would
the public, the society think of
me? Kids are going to slap me. Has it
mere kids. I'm an aesthetic. I have
rigorous
practice. And this is the
ego? The
fear of losing consideration in the eyes
The master exposes it. The master says,
"You see, you love your respectability
more than you love truth. You will get
what you love. You will remain a
socially respectable fellow and you will
So many people are
so scared of being scolded in public,
even if by their
teacher. If you want to instruct us or
reprimand us, kindly do that in a closed
room between you and me in front of a
gathering. Why do you scold me? It's not
as if it is my ego. I'm prepared to take
any kind of beating from you but not in
front of everybody. You see, it must be
between you and me. But the fact
is the teacher has no interest in
beating you in
private. Is the teacher violent towards
you? Does he want to settle a
score? Does he carry some grudge? So why
would he beat you up in a closed room?
The entire point in scolding you is that
you must be scolded in
public because it's not
about scolding. It's about
the ego and ego
thrives. Ego thrives in the eyes of
others. You do not know yourself. So you
look at yourself through the eyes of
others.
break. That is exactly what the master
wants to break. And he says,
"Son, you're not made of that stuff.
You'll not pass this test." He says,
"But I would." He says, "All right, here
it
is. Go
ahead and test
yourself." And he says, "Oh, no, no, no.
What a test. There is no God but God."
He says, "You know what? You're
well." At this juncture, at this very
moment, you have not uttered these words
out of respect for God.
At this moment you have uttered these
words out of self-defense, out of
respect for your
ego.
Ego. So not
only are you liar and a coward, but you
polytheist. Not only are you an
You have been misrepresenting your
faith. You kept on saying that you are a
devout Muslim. You are not. See, you
believe in at least two gods. How can a
H we'll be a little
more direct and harsh upon
ourselves. We'll say we don't even
believe in two
gods. We believe in only one and that
one happens to be a false
god. That false god is our
ego. Now it's upon you. You want to
continue believing in that false
yours. Sir after instructions are after
master lays down instructions why the
disciple says particularly this line
these are lines in
exclamation you utter these lines when
you come across something wondrous when
you come across or when you come across
something beautiful or when you come
across something that really annoys you
it's like ham when do you say ham
something is beautiful you say ham
something is terrible even then you say
that there are only two kinds of people
in the
world those who worship the real god and
those who worship
now do we do Yes,
because the eye, the ego, to myself
looks more real to me than the
god looks more real to whom? To me,
that? Who is that? The eye. No, you
don't know the eye. Even about the eye,
you have only images. Had you known the
ego, you would
have checked it long back. Do you really
ego? How does one know the ego? One
knows the ego through a direct
observation of minuteto- minute facts of
one's
You see when you say I know the
ego and if you have really said this
then you are surrendered to the real god
because real
god has the name of knowing. When you
say I know ego then you have already
said that you are a real devotey because
only a real devotey can know. No knowing
is possible unless you are in the truth.
So even to know the false, you first
have to be in the
truth. It is too much of us to say that
we know the ego. Had you really known
the ego, you would already have been one
with
God. To know the ego, you must be at a
point that is distinct from ego. And
Knowing the ego is not possible if you
are totally identified with the ego. You
will have images about the ego. You'll
have stories about the ego. You will
never really know the ego. Knowing is an
alltogether different
unit. To know is to understand. Really
know is to go to the depth of what you
are looking at. And when you go to the
depth of ego, there is no way you can
still continue with
ego. Once you have seen the beginning
and the end of
ego, you're not going to continue with
it. We have ideas about the ego. We do
not know the ego. Do you really know in
what
ways the ego has raised hell rather
You really
know. You really know in what all ways
the ego makes you do
things that you think you know to be
false. I'll repeat what I'm saying. The
ego makes you do
stuff that you even intellectually do
not believe in. Yet you enter
it. Somebody very nicely put
it. There's a banana
peel. You intellectually very well know.
You step on it and you will slip. But
the ego makes you step on that banana
peel again and again while you
intellectually very well know that
you're going to slip
once again. In fact, you stand looking
at it and you stand wondering. You see
there is this banana peel and after 2
minutes I would have again slipped and
cracked my
hip and you know this very well and
you're imagining you know what I'm
slipping and having known very well what
is going to happen
next you raise your leg and you put your
foot down on the banana peel to slip
again and to suffer again. You really
know the
ego. To know the ego is to be free of
the
ego. Please do know the ego. That is the
only
way of residing in
godliness. You can
never see God
directly. But when you see all the
ungodly things, then the seeing is
godly. Are you getting this?
When you see all the ungodly things,
then the seeing is
godly. So look at the ego. The looking

us? And technologies are so

and
bruised. Still we do not
budge. We say I will remain what I am.

medallions for
our
resilience. To know the ego is to be
able to count the number of scars on

disappointments that you meet every day.
them? To know the ego is to be able to
measure the depth of your hurt. Ever
measured
it? To know the ego is to be able to
value the worth of a life gone
waste. Ever valued the worth of a life
gone
waste? That is when you know what the
ego
does. There is no God. Hence, God cannot
appear real. God does not exist in the
conventional sense of the word
all. God lies in seeing all these things
that take you away from God.
God lies in being able to clearly see
your suffering and the needlessness of
it. That is
godliness. Otherwise, you will never
find a God
directly. So, you're quite right that
God does not really appear real. Ego
appears real. But that is because your
definition of real is the ego.
In that sense obviously God does not
exist at all. The sense in which the ego
exists. God does not exist. Ego is very
very
tangible. God is
not. Ego raises its head and falls keeps
on changing forms is very deceptive. God
is none of these. So if ego is real then
God
obviously is not
real. If the world appears very very
real to you then all these objects
appear real and all the objects are
definite with definite properties with
definite limits. God neither has
properties nor has limits. So in that
exist. Are you getting it? That is the
reason why most people stop believing in
God. They say where is God? Show us now

light behind the eyes. Theishads

when we see terrible crimes like rapes
mass murders lynchings Etc happening so
openly we wonder where that benevolent
God
is he could have easily prevented all of
it he supposed to be
omnipotent yet he does
nothing my question is not whether there
is God or not my question is why is he
so very absent when people need him the
most if you really need the
service if there are rapes then in your
own eyes rape is what you
need does the rapist need God no he
flesh mass murders does the
murderer
need God no he needs revenge or whatever
exploitation he gets
things you would say but what if the
exploited one raped one murdered one
needs God
if the one who has been exploited or
tortured is really God loving in God
full of godliness then all these events
that happen to him or her mean exactly
zero to
him there is no guarantee at all that an
extremely godly woman will never be
raped that can happen it has happened
several times in history it happens
maybe all around us all the time there
is no guarantee that an extremely Godly
person will never be assaulted insulted
or tortured or murdered that can happen
but it would mean nothing at all to that
person huh Others May make stories and
draw their own
conclusions and those conclusions would
always
be
like see such a Godly person and yet he
had to face such a dastardly
end no that's not what the experience or
observation of that killed or raped
person
is there is no
guarantee ever in
life one does not turn spiritual
in order to obtain guarantees regarding
one's experiences or events in life
anything can happen to anybody the most
Godly persons in history have often died
very violent or very ordinary
deaths they have been killed murdered
beheaded publicly executed
stoned I mean you name it you have
instances
in fact the crucification of Christ
Christianity so all those things can
happen to anybody but is
Christ wondering why it is happening to
him doesn't look like if Christ is
really Godly those
are you getting
it the murderer
murders because he is
Godless the raped
one might actually not be raped in spite
of being physically raped if she is
Godly
the murdered one might never be killed
in spite of being physically killed
Immortal it's not the business of Truth
to intervene in your daily Affairs like
Constable another name for God is
freedom
and Truth stands for absolute
freedom you have all the freedom to live
the way you
please you may live in a Godly way you
may live in a totally ungodly
way your
choice it's just that there is something
inside
you that's absolutely crazy for
godliness and if you keep it
deprived it will not let you live sleep
so I mean this
entire concept of a benevolent
omnipotent God is quite childish keep it
malevolent neither full of pity nor full
God is an absolute Giver he has given
you absolute freedom God is an
absolute what you do with that freedom
business it says that if you misuse your
be
similarly the myth of that omnipotent
God
God is Not
omnipotent in the same sense that people
power it's again quite a childish
concept to say God can do anything God
is omnipotent God does not do anything
God is a non- doer God is the ultimate
non-
doer he has left the business of doing
to you all human
beings you do what you would please
because you are the ones hungry for
attainment or hungry for Liberation what
does God have to do with any
doing God is beyond all doing because
desires God did not even perform the
basic doing of creating the universe
what else did do you think he is going
to do at
all no God didn't create the universe
that too is a myth just as these things
God's benevolence God's omnipotence AR a
myth similarly that whole idea of the
myth this world is godliness
itself God or truth or Center or that
first thing
manifests itself as The World God is not
some Creator sitting
elsewhere God is very much in the
creation
itself so even
in the matter of the creation of
universe God does not quite do anything
doing do this do that
whatever then you'll say oh but then who
created the Sun Moon Earth and the Stars
you did not God huh we did but I don't
quite remember creating the
moon maybe my dad did no you create the
moon every time you look at it
yes sir you do God didn't do that you
are creating the moon all the
time you create the Sun every time you
experience the warmth and Radiance of

doesn't then who created me from where
did I come when you ask that question
then you are no more
there ask that question
attentively and you will find that
neither the universe nor you remain now
tell me where is the universe that you
about so these childish Notions about
God have to be exceeded you cannot base
your life with such a concept of God or
godliness and if your life is based on
such chish Concepts
then your life will lack and
immaturity as the lives of most people
anyway do now you know why we live such
immature and kiddish lives because our

When the Lord expands his creation,
Then many types of living beings get
created. When
you
dissolve
everything then all the living beings
get
you. Please help me understand what does
mean? The Lord
Bilash is
consciousness. The world is the expanse
consciousness. The Lord is the source of
your consciousness.
The world is
consciousness. What does
the creation of the world mean?
The
awareness has manifested
itself
into the multiple colors, multiple
levels of
consciousness. That is the creation of
the
being. The world and consciousness are
one. God and the source of consciousness
mean for consciousness to
dissolve and go back to God?
consciousness? The contents of
Whenever you say you are conscious, you
are always conscious of something. So
consciousness always has
contents. When you say you are thinking,
you are always
thinking about something. So
consciousness is nothing without its
contents.
What does it mean then for the world to
be absorbed back into God? It
means that now you
have consciousness without content or
you have pure
awareness. You can express it either
way. You could either say now there is
consciousness sense the contents of
consciousness in the sense that now the
ego tendency finds no need to associate
itself identify itself affiliate itself
with any of the contents of
consciousness. Or you could say
consciousness itself has receded and is
now finding rest in pure awareness.
There is no
expanse. There is just a
I? Are you getting
how the
mind becomes full of some content when
you are excited or angry?
or
lustful. That is the expanse of
consciousness. Now consciousness is very
very strongly associated with some
content. You can't stop thinking about
This you could call as the emergence of
the world. Now the world has emerged and
become very meaningful for
you. And what is meant
by dissolution of the world?
Ah,
grace
shown and the eye
wise and loosened its grip
over the
pretty object of
association. Now the content has
been dropped.
dropped. Consciousness no more because
we said there is no consciousness
without
content. You could either call it
consciousness no more or you could call
it pure consciousness which means
consciousness without content. One is
conscious but one is not conscious of
anything in particular. That is called
pure consciousness.
Normally when you are conscious there is
something in your mind right you are
always conscious of something I
repeat what is pure consciousness or
awareness
there is consciousness but of what?
particular. One knows
what? Nothing in particular. When you
know but know nothing in particular,
then you actually
know. When you know only the
particulars, then what the hell do you
know? All that you know is the
particular and the particular is the
little and little knowledge is no
knowledge.
Therefore, knowing or awareness is when
you know
without knowing anything specific. You
just know that is
awareness. When you know something
specific then you are.
When you just know without knowing
anything specific then only the knowing
is you are
not. I'll repeat. When you know
something specific than you
know nothing is specific, then you are
not
only knowing
is that you could also call as knowing
without the
consciousness, knowledge is always with
a knower. So there is knower and he has
knowledge. And this is the usual process
of
consciousness. In awareness, there is
only
knowing. There is no object of knowledge
and therefore no
knower. Therefore you can be conscious
but you can never be aware.
In consciousness, the eye is preserved
and strengthened. In awareness, there is

Vilash quotes again from the nitname
kahani. Whatever happened in the past is
going to happen in the future and is
happening
now. Bilash says I'm not clear about
this statement. How should one look at
past, present and future? I have heard
people telling me to live in present.
What does this really mean?
This statement in name seems to indicate
that the future is nothing but a
repetition of the past. Is it indicating
for that for a person living in time the
past, present and future are the same
and we need to go towards timelessness?
Please help me understand this. Yes,
The ego
loves time. The ego hopes that time will

opt out of time. It continues to swim in
time. And in time there is no newness.
past. Awareness is new. Consciousness is
still. Mark the
difference. In
awareness, great and fresh things
happen. In
consciousness, petty and stale things
happen. Consciousness is so scared it
merely wants to repeat the
past. Awareness is so
fearless it abhors
repetitions. In awareness there is
creativity. In
consciousness there is merely a
replication.
consciousness is

Procriti is movement and movement can

everything is
changing. If you are restless you cannot
sit still can you? If you are
changing. In priti there is continuous
change. In prriti there is time. And yet
pracrati never changes fully. It changes
in its own
time like a flowing river in which there
is continuous
change but
within the two banks the limits of the

past, you have jealousy now. You had
insecurity in the past, you have
insecurity now. You can go back 4,000
insecurity. And irrespective of how long
back you go, you'll always find a
three-dimensional world, won't you? Oh,
What has
changed? The world was always
threedimensional, was it not?
this unchanging framework of
consciousness, there are cosmetic
changes in the objects of consciousness.
That's hardly any change. And therefore,
the fundamental condition of man has
remained the
same. Man was fearful 5,000 years back.
He is fearful even
today. People were fighting for property
5,000 years back. They're fighting for
today. Men were fighting for women 5,000
years back. Even today, it's the same.
What has changed?
So the saints are saying whatever
happened in the past is going to happen
in the future and is happening even
now. Does that mean there is no
possibility of liberation? There is.
There were liberated ones in the past
and there are liberated ones today as
well. The ones who have to live
contained in time continue to live

whatever we are doing in this life
whatever is happening in the universe is
this already defined by God with we
being merely players or is God nowhere
in picture these are the two options
that your mind can come up with one all
is predestined with me being the in
actors of gods pre-scripted will or the
second option is well no there is
nothing pre-scripted there is no god
what is happening is happening out of
the forces of nature of the universe in
both these options the underlying
assumption is the same the underlying
assumption is that there is time and
there is space and there is happening
pay attention whether you say that God
has predetermined the course of destiny
hmm individual destiny as well as the
destiny of the universe or whether you
say that no whatever is happening is
happening out of the interplay of
physical forces and that there is man's
free will and a ruler god did not be
there whichever of these two options you
put forth the underlying assumption is
the assumption is that there is a stream
of time the assumption is that cause and
whether or not there is a god that is
causing all this is it not prudent to
first ask whether anything is happening
at all is it not important to first ask
whether the stream of time that you are
seeing is really there or merely a
mental construct is that not a more
important question see who is your God
your God is an agency that you require
to explain the universe you see the sex
universe around you hmm
you see all this diversity around you
you see human beings and planets and the
entire universe hmm and you see the flow
of time and you see cause-and-effect you
see creator and creation so you wonder
that there must be something in time in
past who would have created all this
that is how you come to God right the
principle creator that is how man comes
to God hmm so in coming to God first of
all you are assuming that there is this
creation now what is this creation let's
pay more attention to this first this is
of primary concern is this there this
has to be there so that your God may
exist right and if it turns out that
there is some lacunae here itself in the
first step then there is no point in
discussing some creator god are you
getting it how do you say that something
is there you have said let whatever we
are doing this life and all that
where are they how do you know that
there is you that there are others that
there is the world how do you know of
all
you know of all that only through your
senses only through your senses so your
senses tell you that the world exists at
the same time your senses are a part of
the world there is no verification for
the world except your senses is there
any way you can verify that the world
exists if the senses are not there would
you say something exists if it cannot be
touched heard or seen or if you do not
even have a memory of it you'll not see
it exists right so the existence of the
world is contingent upon your senses and
what you call as your senses are very
much a part of the world do you see that
this is cyclical
do you see this to verify anything there
must be an independent agency right if I
want to verify that you are here then I
have to be separate from you there has
to be an agency independent of that
which is being verified the senses are
verifying the world and the senses
themselves are a part and product of the
world so how can the senses verify the
world similarly what you call as
cause-and-effect creator and creation is
again a flow of time who's telling you
that time really exists does time really
where is time except in sensory
so first of all if there is an
independent agency it has to be free of
the world which is space and it has to
be free of time because both the world
the world and its past you say there is
a world here right now as you see and
you say that there is a path to take
this world hmm a process through which
the world has emerged and come to this
position that's what you say right first
of all that supreme independent agency
cannot be a part of this as you see it
right now and cannot be a part of the
stream of time so let's not search for
creation in the past because past itself
denotes time and there is no time time
itself is a fallacy let us not say that
God created the world and then God
pre-scripted our destinies we create
right we create a house we create a
computer that's what we do so we think
God must have done the same that's how a
man's mind works
it creates God in its own image just as
we create things so we think God too
must have created know we operate in
time God by definition is the
not within time so what is it then that
is really there it is not in past if it
is not in the past where could it be
obviously not in the future what are we
this this that is not a part of time
this from which all time emerges this
from which all imaginations of the time
arise but this which is not a part of
time hmm God is here what is here and
I'm using God in a way in the same sense
as you did as that independent agency
the source the source of all creation is
not the creator then at least the source
now a god like this that is not in the
past that cannot have a physical form
that cannot be spread out in space how
do we talk about it obviously he cannot
be a part of any other of our concepts
because all our concepts will require
time and space otherwise there can be no
conceptualization how do we say anything
on a subject involving God how do we say
anything because the moment we will say
anything it would be coming from that
same mind which requires images and time
and space and all that how do we say
anything to say anything on this topic
requires a mind that is deeply
meditative that is so very meditative
that there is no place for thoughts or
concepts in it and then whatever emerges
is godly that itself is God that itself
that entire flow whatever is happening
the happening not the happened not the
you could even call it creativity
continuous creation which cannot be
frozen at a point in time which is there
right now and what kind of creation well
that depends upon the mind that is
looking at the creation because God is
just a particular point uncreated but
mind is the one that sees the creation
right you are the one who is talking
about creation you are the one who's
talking about universe and if there are
so many people in this hall right now
then there are an equal number of
universes at any point in time so this
particular creation are you talking
about that particular creation which
corresponds to your mind are you getting
creation depends on the mind obviously
that mind is powered by the center and
the source but creation depends on the
mind
so which creation you are looking at
that is the quality of your mind who
God is not at all interested in creating
anything God has no agenda in sending
man to earth all those are just
in Nice fairy tales - creates man man
creates man but the power to create is
God's do you see this please understand
this who creates the universe you create
the universe universe is your
imagination you look at the universes
your mental configuration is nobody else
creates the universe you do that but the
very power to even imagine is not yours
left to yourself there is no yourself so
universe is just an imagination the
source of which is God who is imagining
you are imagining who is imagining you
are imagining God has not created
anything he does not do anything
he has no space where to do anything
sitting outside space how can the poor
fellow do anything but yes he's so full
so contended that when you're hungry
mind begs for powers all powers flow
effortlessly from him God did not come
and create the birds God did not make
the planets the planets are all yours
the birds are all yours your body is all
yours you are creating it how not only
biologically but actually
psychologically you are creating your
body and if your mental configuration
changes the universe that you see around
you will change change exactly as much
there is nothing real here nothing at
all all that is here is only as real as
then what is the space for destiny in
the world that the mind creates operates
on cause and effect and there is an
entire chain rather a network of cause
and effect hmm everything in this
universe is interrelated through causal
chains that is the nature of our
imagination that is just the nature of
the universe everything is interlinked
one cause here another effect there and
behind every effect are a million causes
and behind every cause are other million
causes of which the primary causes what
is the primary cause of the cause behind
all causes what is that that must lie
outside the cause and effect change and
we have just talked of that as God hmm
so he God is the primary cause but the
cause that lies outside the cause-effect
Network all right
in any case the universe is just a
network of cause and effect and
everything that you see operating here
it's surely mechanical and predestined
there is nothing here that is not caused
by something else there's nothing here
so your question is are we just waves of
destiny yes we are we surely are slaves
of destiny there is no doubt about it to
the extent you are a part of the
universe there is nothing but destiny to
the extent you are a human body there is
nothing but destiny there is birth and
there is death there is a particular
time when you were born there is a
particular physical form in which you
were born there is a particular gender
in which you were born there is a
particular place in which you were born
at which you were born
and all that is destiny all that is
destiny to the extent you are a part of
the universe you are a slave of the
destiny
so the worldly man is a slave of the
destiny because he is nothing but a part
of the world but to the extent you are
not a part of this world to the extent
you are a son a daughter of the source
you are not a slave of destiny please
understand this this universe is nothing
but a network of cause and effect
everything in this universe all material
and the universe's material and space
right everything in this universe is
governed by laws of cause and effect
simple so if you are a material part of
this universe that is the body which is
a material part of the universe if you
are a body then there is only destiny
and that is slavery of the deepest kind
right nothing in my control nothing
really mine Who am I and entity
dependent on a million forces outside me
but we of course know that outside the
cause-effect Network lies something what
is that you need not name it you know
right so if you can be connected to that
then you are outside destiny till the
time you will remain in the world
destiny will rule but to the extent you
find yourself with the first cause you
surrender to the center to the source
there is no destiny no hmm you are now
with the power much bigger than that of
destiny no destiny cannot touch you
events will happen
but they will not touch the center they
can never touch the center right but for
you to remain untouched where must you
be located at the center destiny rules
the universe destiny doesn't rule God if
you are aligned with the universe
identified with the universe destiny
will rule you if you are identified with
God forget destiny
neither destiny nor time nor world
nothing can touch you you're outside
death ultimately distinct takes you to
death right the one who is outside the
world goes outside death now even death
cannot touch you such is your power but
remember that power does not belong to
the human being the woman the lady the
whatever you are that power does not
belong to you as you're sitting here you
are just a part of the universe you
cannot be outside destiny this thing
that is sitting here this material body
this can never be outside universe and
hence this can never be free from
destiny the body will die this can never
escape destiny the body will die but
there is something else that is outside
destiny and you must find it out it is
your very center that is the point we
are contentment lies that is the point
where your search ends that is your very
center very source so never blame
destiny never destiny is important in
front of those who know what is their
real identity the still cannot do
anything neither can destiny help them
nor hinder them this Tilly is not a
question at all the universe is
operating I am watching what harm can it
